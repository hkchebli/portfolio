## User Story

* As the User, I would like to write a code from scratch to build my own portfolio.
## Acceptance Criteria

* I create a navigation bar that include the titles of the categories introduced in my portfolio
* I create an amazing text animation for the header (my name)
* I create an hover animation for nav bar elements (rise up and underline)
* I create a box for each category and design it 
* I add a background image to the webpage body that suits the style of the page
* I add an image of myself under the nav bar
* i add a hover animation to the image that scales it to make the image more clear
* I add a hover and focus animation to categories' boxes that scale them to be bigger and cause a fade to make them more clear and show the user where he's looking
* I add logos that represent each category in the boxes
* I add the corresponding information to each category box
